# Arduino-with-VS
Combines some projects using Arduino and Visual Studios. Most project will build in C++. 

List of Projects:
* Simple Serial Communication (Completed)

  Use Visual Studio 2017 to receive data from Arduino.   
  Notice that the type of project must be "Visual C++  CLR Console Application" to  access the `System::IO::ports` namespace.
  
* IMU 3D Simulation (Working)

  Use Visual Studio 2017 to read the IMU data from Arduino and plot the 3D graph with OpenGL. Still working on...
